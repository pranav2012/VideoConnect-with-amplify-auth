# amplify-auth-with-auth-rules

### About the Task

it was great project i loved working on it. everything is implemented as mentioned on the task
i also made it responsive added error handling and form validation with email verification as well.
i have used s3 buckets for storing videos, aws amplify for setting up autthentication as well as graphql serverless 
backend for database im using DynamoDB.

### Trade off's in the Task

for validation's i can use formik and yup but to make the code base smaller i decided to use validator to validate 
input field's, another trade off is i used object-fit class for video to make them strech and fit the container which distrupt's the aspect ratio otherwise there will be blank space in the video container. if i would have more time i will probably add a button to delete our video.
